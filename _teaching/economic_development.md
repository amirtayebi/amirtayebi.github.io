**Course description**: Development economics is a diverse field addressing a range of vital issues. How can we accurately identify,
measure, and alleviate poverty? Why is not the whole world developed? What can history teach us about the
process of development and about the prospects for the future? What is the role of geography, institutions,
and trade? What are the current issues in development? This course will cover many of these topics through
readings, lecture, and discussion.
